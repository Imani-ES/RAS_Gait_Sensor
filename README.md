# RAS_Gait_Sensor

People who suffer from diseases that affect their walking, like Parkinson’s disease, require rehabilitation to help them regain their ability to walk safely. Systems that use Rhythmic Auditory Stimulation (RAS) have been shown to help patients more quickly regain their walking ability, compared to traditional rehabilitation methods. We will develop a knee sensor to obtain useful data about the patient’s walking patterns. This data and sensor will be used in conjunction with a RAS desktop application.

## Use Cases
Rehabilitation for people with Parkinson’s gait disease, other neurodegenerative diseases which negatively affect their walking ability, stroke victims, etc. 
Possible general use for athletes, at-home diagnostics, personal use, etc.

## Features
A wearable knee sensor that can accurately measure a user’s knee angle within ± 5°
The sensor is wireless and transmits data without physical connections
The battery powered sensor is adjustable, ensuring a wide range of users can wear it comfortably
Users can hear music that is equivalent to the BPM they want to walk to

This code contains the components of the accompanying Music App that will be used with the Knee Sensor
